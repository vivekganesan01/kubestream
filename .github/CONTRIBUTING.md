## Contributing to my project:
---

Thank you for considering contributing to Kubestream! I developed this project to gain expertise in Go and my main goal is to keep it simple and user-friendly while incorporating Go features like concurrency, interfaces, and higher-order functions. I hope you can help me with learning Go.


## Getting Started

    Kubestream is CLI tool which is similar to kubectl (client side) but it streams resources metadata and information from multiple kubernetes cluster at once.

### Prerequisites

- Runtime Go 1.19
- make build

```
./kubestream --help
```

Refer: README.md for usage
